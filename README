Hello friend, this repository contains web development files for
int80.

The master branch is a "skeleton" template for a catalyst webapp, each
actual website is a branch off the master.

Branches are: 
  master
  iashomepage
  homepage
  and lots more.

To switch to a branch (e.g. iashomepage):
 $ git checkout origin/iashomepage

To push changes back to unfuddle:
 $ git push origin origin/iashomepage

To switch back to master:
 $ git checkout master

To diff master vs. iashomepage (see what is different between the
skeleton and the iashomepage site):
 $ git diff master origin/iashomepage
