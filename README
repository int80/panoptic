Hello friend, this repository contains web development files for
int80.

The master branch is a "skeleton" template for a catalyst webapp, each
actual website is a branch off the master.


To see all remote branches:
 $ git branch -r

To switch to a branch for the first time and track the remote branch
 (e.g. iashomepage):
 $ git fetch origin   # make sure we're up-to-date first
 $ git checkout -t -b iashomepage origin/iashomepage
 $ git pull

To push changes back to unfuddle:
 $ git push

To switch back to master:
 $ git checkout master

To switch to a branch you are already tracking locally:
 $ git checkout iashomepage

To diff master vs. iashomepage (see what is different between the
skeleton and the iashomepage site):
 $ git diff master origin/iashomepage

To make a new site branched off from master:
 $ tools/create-site.sh newsite
